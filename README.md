## Project Summary
The Vendor Performance Analysis project aims to evaluate and analyze the performance of vendors in the Operations department. The analysis focuses on delivery performance, product quality, and associated costs. By examining these key metrics, the project seeks to identify opportunities for process optimization, cost savings, and quality improvement. The analysis findings and recommendations will enable the Operations department and executive team to make data-driven decisions and enhance vendor management strategies.

## Project Objectives
- Evaluate delivery performance and distribution (on-time vs. early deliveries)
- Analyze total freight costs over multiple years
- Assess product quality trends and rejection rates
- Identify potential correlations between vendor performance and associated costs
- Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing vendor performance and optimizing costs
- Improve overall product quality through vendor collaboration and negotiation

## Business Value from this project
- Enhanced Delivery Performance: By analyzing delivery performance and identifying trends, the project aims to improve on-time delivery rates, reduce lead times, and enhance customer satisfaction.
- Cost Optimization: The project will identify opportunities for cost savings through strategic vendor negotiations, exploring vendors with on-time deliveries and higher ship base costs, and streamlining supply chain processes.
- Improved Product Quality: Through continuous quality monitoring and collaboration with vendors experiencing higher reject percentages, the project aims to address quality issues and improve product quality across operations.
- Data-Driven Decision-Making: The analysis findings and recommendations will provide valuable insights to the Operations department and executive team, enabling them to make informed decisions for vendor management and operational optimization.
